   h3 Project Staffing (Gold)
   p With Project Staffing, Proridium takes the responsibility to deliver a turnkey system that meets your business needs.  This black box solution relieves customers of the burden and risk of building, training and maintaining complex software teams.
   p Today's technical organizations play many roles: development, testing, technology migration, and training, to name just few. Unfortunately, increased responsibilities do not always come with a larger staff. Many organizations juggle too many projects without enough resources. In a world driven increasingly by e-commerce, that is simply dangerous.
   p Every organization occasionally needs some help. Maybe you've been handed a new initiative and you don't have the resources to manage it. Perhaps you're trying to convince your company to invest in a systems upgrade, but need objective analysis to support your conclusions. Whatever your need, Proridium can help you assemble the right team of people to find a solution and immediately implement it.
