      p Foresight
   p A systems modeling and simulation tool which incorporates:
   ul
      li FS/Model - Graphical & textual model editors for construction of executable system models using hierarchical flow diagrams, state diagrams, procedural descriptions, and libraries. Includes a collection of 100+ pre-built library elements (such as queues, filters, resources, etc.) as well as the capability for the user to create their own reusable library elements.
      li FS/Sim - Highly interactive, simulation engine for executing system models and performing a wide variety of analysis: functional verification, performance analysis, behavioral correctness. Ihttp://ncludes a host of debugging, data monitoring/collection, and execution options.
      li FS/Vis - Data visualizer for displaying simulation results in a variety of ways, including x-y plots, strip charts, timelines, and histograms.
      li FS/AltiaLite- Human interface prototyper, to mock up a realistic user interface for your system, and while linked with your Foresight executable system model, interact with the system under design.
      li FS/Doc - Automatic generation of documents from your system model.
   span
      img(src="./img/eye.gif")
      p Foresight Co-Design
   p All of the above capabalities of Foresight plus co-simulation with Mentor Graphics Seamless CVE and ModelSim. Mixed level analysis enables detailed HW and SW models to be run with the full system model.

   span
      img(src="./img/eye.gif")
      p FS/CoderC
   p Automatic generation of (ANSI or K&R) C code from your Foresight system models. Can be used to create:
   ul
      li fast, batch simulations of your models, and
      li standalone prototypes of your system.

   span

      p FS/RQIF
   p Requirements traceability interfaces to third-party requirements management tools

   span
