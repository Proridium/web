      p Foresight is a power design tool that helps system designers identify and eliminate errors early in the product development process, when they are the easiest and least expensive to repair. By employing a revolutionary approach known as the "executable specification", Foresight's advanced modeling and simulation technology highlights performance problems, roots out conflicting requirements, uncovers fundamental design flaws and provides a complete and robust functional and architectural representation of the target product.

      p Foresight's powerful system level modeling capability allows users to capture, design, model, and simulate (execute) the system specification to verify the optimal functional and performance characteristics. The Foresight family of products have been used on hundreds of complex, embedded systems ranging from large scale systems applications such as the Joint Strike Fighter and the Mars Rover Project to complex systems-on-chip designs for imaging, multimedia and telecommunications.

      h2 Hardware/Software Co-Design is here
      p Foresight’s versatile and general purpose modeling notation allows designers to capture system attributes in both a behavioral and an architectural form. Combining these representations into a common executable specification promotes early verification of design requirements and parameters. This unified modeling framework, which is capable of representing a system at varying levels of abstraction, is unique to Foresight. By mapping functional elements of a design to a variety of alternative architectures, system designers can quickly explore tradeoffs, allowing them to achieve an optimal specification. For example, evaluating hardware/software trade-offs is as straightforward as mapping a functional task to both a CPU (software) and to an ASIC (hardware) and then evaluating performance, throughput, and capacity results for each alternative.

      p Through the use of Foresight’s extensible co-design framework, it is possible to replace high level architectural elements with detailed hardware/software components emulated in Mentor Graphics Corp’s Seamless Co-Verification Environment (Seamless CVE) and HDL simulation environment (ModelSim). The interface between the system level model (represented in Foresight Co-Design) and hardware of software specific elements of the system model (represented in Seamless CVE) creates a multiple abstraction level test framework for further design refinement and system design validation.
