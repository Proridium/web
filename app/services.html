      </ul>

      <h3>Project Staffing (Gold)</h3>
      <p>With Project Staffing, Proridium takes the responsibility to deliver a turnkey system that meets your business needs.  This black box solution relieves customers of the burden and risk of building, training and maintaining complex software teams.</p>
      <p>Today's technical organizations play many roles: development, testing, technology migration, and training, to name just few.

In a world driven increasingly by e-commerce, that is simply dangerous.</p>
      <p>Every organization occasionally needs some help. Maybe you've been handed a new initiative and you don't have the resources to manage it. Perhaps you're trying to convince your company to invest in a systems upgrade, but need objective analysis to support your conclusions. Whatever your need, Proridium can help you assemble the right team of people to find a solution and immediately implement it.</p>
      <h3>Win-Win with Proridium</h3>
      <p>Whether it's an ace Project Manager, a Project Leader and team, or a high-powered team of experienced consultants, the choice is yours.</p>
      <p>No more high-priced, high-overhead big company solutions.</p>
      <p>It’s your project, your culture, and your business…with Proridium, you’re in total control.  Proridium assembles a solution so that you always come out victorious.</p>
